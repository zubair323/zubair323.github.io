    <h3>About Me</h3>
   I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Robotics Institute (CMU), working on an interdisciplinary project with four advisers/collaborators:  Anthony Tomasic (Language Technologies), Charles Garrod (Sofwtare Engineering), Aaron Steinfeld (Robotics), and John Zimmermann (HCI). <br>
    
   Earlier I was a research fellow with the Center for Identity at the University of Texas at Austin where I worked with Dr. Suzanne Barber from August 2013 to September 2014 <br>
    
   I completed my PhD with Dr. Sarfarz Khurshid at the University of Texas at Austin in August 2014. My PhD research work was completed in July 2013. <br>

<P><HR><P> 
    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    My research focuses on enhancing reliabilityof computer systems through software verification, validation and testing. My work directly enablesadvanced manufacturing, enhances software security, and improves fault tolerance of robots andautonomous computing agents.
    I am interested in leveraging the advances in verification, constraint-solving, cloud-computing, big-data and machine-learning for
improving techniques in program transformation, program understanding, security and automated debugging. <br>
